# Typing Speed Test Application

A web-based typing speed test app designed for developers, focused on improving typing skills by practicing real JavaScript and Python code snippets.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to help users—especially coding learners and developers—enhance their typing speed and accuracy using real programming code. Key features will include:

- Programming language selection (JavaScript or Python)
- Multiple difficulty levels
- Real-time feedback: Words Per Minute (WPM), accuracy, and time tracking
- User progress tracking
- Clean, responsive UI

The application will be developed collaboratively by a team of four, with daily standups, GitHub Kanban usage, and iterative development over 7 working days.

## 🧠 Team & Collaboration

- 4 developers working in pairs on frontend and logic
- Daily standups and GitHub Kanban board tracking
- Clear task division and regular syncs

## 🔜 Next Steps

- Set up Kanban board on GitHub Projects
- Create wireframes and basic flow diagram
- Define core components and routes
- Begin incremental feature implementation
